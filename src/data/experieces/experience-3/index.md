I volunteered at the Northern California Rehabilitation Hospital supervising and providing education to patients on the effective use of the equipment and common games to meet their treatment goals. Certain patients utilized specialized activities for their treatment under the supervision of the recreational therapist. Patients responses were evaluated and reported to the recreation therapist so that modifications could be made to improve their activities.
